## A basic memory game with an added audio feature.

The main purpose of this game to help young music students have fun while learning music Intervals. The game consists of 16 tiles, which are 8 sets of matching pairs. It's a version of the popular game 'Concentration'. At the beginning of the game all of the tiles are blanked out. Two tiles are flipped over on each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching tiles. In this version of the game the tiles are named after a music interval (Unison, Major 2nd, Major 3rd, Perfect 4th etc.) and when clicked, will also play that music interval as a learning mechanism. 

Over the course of the game, it becomes known where certain tiles are located, and so upon turning up one tile, players with good memory will be able to remember where they have already seen its pair. The player aims to match all the pairs in as little moves as possible. Once they finish the game, they get an option to play again.
